# ML Data Workbench

As I progressed through my machine learning journey, I realized that **preparing the data** is just as important—if not more—than training the model itself. This repository is a collection of notebooks I created while learning how to **manipulate, clean, transform, and structure data** before feeding it into ML algorithms.

While models often get all the attention, this repo focuses on everything that comes **before** modeling — the **foundation** of any successful machine learning project.

## 📘 What This Repository Covers

These notebooks cover key concepts and practical steps in:

- 📦 **Data Loading & Exploration**
- 🧹 **Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- 📊 **Outlier Detection**
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering**
- 🧱 **Pipeline Construction**
- 📉 **Data Visualization**
- 📏 **Evaluation Preparation**


##  Why I Made This

I wanted to build a **personal reference** and a **beginner-friendly guide** for anyone learning:
- How to clean and prepare datasets
- Why pipelines matter
- How preprocessing decisions impact final model performance

This is not a tutorial on ML algorithms — it's about getting the data **ready** for them.
